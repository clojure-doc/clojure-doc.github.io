## What Version of Clojure Does This Guide Cover?

This guide covers Clojure 1.11.


## Binding

<a id="let_desc"></a>
### let

```clojure
(let [bindings*] exprs*)
```

`let` takes a vector of symbol/expression pairs (bindings) followed by a variable number of expressions.

`let` allows binding of locals (roughly equivalent to variables in many other languages), and evaluates the expressions (with those bindings in scope).

The body of a `let` statement also provides an [implicit `do`](#do) that allows for multiple statements in the body of `let`.

A basic example:

```klipse-clojure
(let [x 1 y 2]
  (println x y))
```

`let` does its bindings sequentially, meaning it's possible to reference previous bindings:

```klipse-clojure
(let [a 5
      b (* a 2)
      c (+ a b)]
  (println "c is" c))
```

`let` can also be nested, and the scope is lexically determined. This means that a binding's value is determined by the nearest binding form for that symbol.

This example demonstrates the lexical scoping of the let form.

```klipse-clojure
(let [x 1]
  (println x) ; prints 1
  (let [x 2]
    (println x)) ; prints 2
  (println x)) ; outside the nested let, prints 1 again
```

`let` bindings are immutable and can be destructured.

See: Sections about destructuring in
[Introduction](/articles/tutorials/introduction/#destructuring) and
[Functions](/articles/language/functions/#destructuring-of-function-arguments)
pages.


<a id="def_desc"></a>
### def

```clojure
(def symbol doc-string? init?)
```

`def` takes a symbol, an optional docstring, and an optional init value
(although it is very rare that you would omit the init value), and creates
(or re-assigns) a var in the current namespace with the name of the symbol.
If an init value is supplied, the root binding of the var is assigned to that 
value. Redefining a var with an init value will re-assign the root binding. 
If no init value is supplied and the var is newly-created, it will be 'unbound',
otherwise the var already exists and its value is unchanged.

A root binding is a value that is shared across all threads.

```clojure
(def x)
x ; x is an 'unbound' var, or nil in clojurescript
; => #object [clojure.lang.Var$Unbound 0x1de19fc6 "Unbound: #'user/x"]
(def x 7)
x ; x is now 7
; => 7
(def x)
x ; x is still 7, deffing with no value doesn't unbind an existing value
; => 7
```

### def vs let

Superficially, `def` and `let` both give names to values. A key difference is that `let` bindings are scoped and don't have a namespace, while vars created with `def` are 'global' and qualified to a namespace. A name/binding that should only exist within (for example) a function should be created with `let`, and it's very rarely needed/advisable to use `def` within a function or other form.

```klipse-clojure
; def creates (and returns) vars in the current namespace
(def my-secret-number 5)
(def my-secret-string "hi")
(let [my-secret-number 7] ; this is a local that's not available outside the let block
  (vector my-secret-number cljs.user/my-secret-number my-secret-string))  
```

In the output of this example:
- `my-secret-number` resolves to the local from the surrounding `let`
- `cljs.user/my-secret-number` resolves to the var created by `def` (because the `let` binding doesn't have a namespace)
- `my-secret-string` resolves to the var - since there's no local named `my-secret-string`, clojure looks for bindings available in the current namespace.

See [Vars and the Global Environment](https://clojure.org/reference/vars) in
the official Clojure reference documentation for more details, which also
covers how to attach metadata to such Vars.

<a id="declare_desc"></a>
### declare

```clojure
(declare names*)
```

`declare` takes zero or more symbols and behaves as if you had used `def` on
each without an init value.

`declare` provides a simple way of creating 'forward declarations'.
This allows for referencing of a var before it has been supplied a value.

There are much better methods of value-based dispatch or code architecture in
general, but this presents a simple situation forward declarations would be necessary.

```klipse-clojure
(declare func<10 func<20)

;; without declare you will receive an error similar to:
;; "Unable to resolve symbol: func10 in this context"

(defn func<10 [x]
  (cond
   (< x 10) (func<10 (inc x))
   (< x 20) (func<20 x)
   :else "too far!"))

(defn func<20 [x]
  (cond
   (< x 10) (func<10 x)
   (< x 20) "More than 10, less than 20"
   :else "too far!"))
```

No matter which order you put func<10 and func<20 in, there will be a reference to a var that does not yet exist when the compiler does the initial evaluation of top-level forms.

`declare` defines the var with no binding so that the the var exists when it is referenced later in the code.

<a id="defn_desc"></a>
### defn

```clojure
(defn name doc-string? attr-map? [params*] prepost-map? body)
(defn name doc-string? attr-map? ([params*] prepost-map? body)+ attr-map?)
```

`defn` takes a symbol, an optional doc string, an optional meta-data
map, a vector of arguments and a variable number of expressions.

`defn` is the primary way of defining functions. It allows for
convenient definition of metadata about its argslist and documentation
(docstrings). `defn` inherently allows for quick documentation of
functions that can be retrieved with `doc`. This feature should be
used almost universally.

```klipse-clojure
(defn func [x]
  x)
(func 7)
```
Because `defn` has multiple forms and a handful of optional parameters, there's a separate section
that does a deep dive on defining [functions](/articles/language/functions).

See the [`def` Special Form](https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#def)
for more detail about how `defn` provides additional metadata and convenience
over `def`.

## Branching/Grouping

### do

```clojure
(do exprs*)
```
`do` is used to 'group' expressions together. It executes the expressions in order and returns the return value of 
the final expression. It is often used when it's necessary to treat multiple expressions as one 'block', like an argument to `if`.

<a id="if_desc"></a>
### if

```clojure
(if test then else?)
```

`if` takes two or three expressions -- a condition expression, a 'then' expression, and optionally an 'else' expression. If the 'else' expression is not supplied, it defaults to `nil`.

`if` is the primary method of conditional execution, and other conditionals are built upon `if`.

The condition is evaluated, and if its value is truthy -- anything except `nil`
or `false` -- the 'then' expression is evaluated and the result returned
(the 'else' expression is not evaluated).

If the first expression returns `nil` or
`false` the 'else' expression is evaluated and returned
(the 'then' expression is not evaluated).

```klipse-clojure
(if 0 "second") ; 0 is a 'true' value. Only false or nil are 'false'
```

```klipse-clojure
(if nil "second" "third")
```

```klipse-clojure
(if (< 10 9) "second" "third") ; (< 10 9) returns false
```

```klipse-clojure
; seq returns nil for an empty sequence, 
; so the third expression (defaulted to nil) is returned
(if (seq '()) "second")
```

```klipse-clojure
(if (nil? (= 1 2)) "second" "third") ; differentiate between nil and false if needed
```

```klipse-clojure
; to do multiple things based on the condition, use a `do`
(if (> 4 3)
  (do
    (println "4 is greater than 3...")
    (println "so 3 is less than 4")
    "4!")
  (println "Uh oh, math is broken."))
```

<a id="when_desc"></a>
### when

```clojure
(when test body*)
```

`when` takes a test and zero or more `body` expressions. If the test returns a truthy
value, all the `body` expressions are evaluated in an implicit `do`, and the last return
value is the return value of `when`. If the test is not truthy, `nil` is returned (the 
body expressions are not evaluated at all).

Put another way, `(when test body)` is transformed to `(if test (do body))`.

```klipse-clojure
;; (= 1 2) is false so the other expressions are not evaluated
(when (= 1 2) (println "hey") 10)
```

```klipse-clojure
;; (< 10 11) is true so both expressions are evaluated and the last value returned
(when (< 10 11) (println "hey") 10)
```

There might be some unfamiliar syntax, but this demo shows that the `when` is transformed to an `if` expression (this is an example of a [macro](/articles/language/macros)). 

```klipse-clojure
(macroexpand '(when (< 3 4) (println "true text") (println "more true text")))
```

## Looping

<a id="recur_desc"></a>
### recur

```clojure
(recur exprs*)
```

`recur` allows for self-recursion without consuming stack space proportional to the number of recursive calls made. Due to the lack of tail-call optimization on the JVM currently, this is the only method of recursion that does not consume excess stack space.

`recur` takes a number of arguments identical to the point of recursion. `recur` will evaluate those arguments, rebind them at the point of recursion and resume execution at that point.

The point of recursion is the nearest function (`defn`, `fn`) or `loop` form determined lexically.

`recur` must be in the tail position of the recursion point expression. The tail position is the point in the expression where a return value would otherwise be determined.

`recur` does not bind `&` in variadic functions and in these situations an empty seq must be passed by `recur`.

```klipse-clojure
(defn count-up
  [result x y]
  (if (= x y)
    result
    (recur (conj result x) (inc x) y)))

(count-up [] 0 10)
```

Example: getting factorial of a positive integer:

```klipse-clojure
(defn factorial
  ([n]
     (factorial n 1))
  ([n acc]
     (if (zero? n)
       acc
       (recur (dec n) (* n acc)))))

(factorial 10)
;; ⇒ 3628800
```

<a id="loop_desc"></a>
### loop

```clojure
(loop [bindings*] exprs*)
```

`loop` takes a vector of symbol value pairs followed by a variable number of expressions.

`loop` establishes a recursion point for a `recur` expression inside its body. `loop` provides an implicit `let` for bindings.

The implicit `let` that `loop` provides binds each symbol to the init-expression. `recur` then binds new values when returning the execution point to `loop`.

```klipse-clojure
(defn count-up
  [start total]
  (loop [result []
         x start
         y total]
    (if (= x y)
      result
      (recur (conj result x) (inc x) y))))

(count-up 0 10)
;; ⇒ [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
```

Example: getting factorial of a positive integer:

```klipse-clojure
(defn factorial
  [n]
  (loop [n n
         acc 1]
    (if (zero? n)
      acc
      (recur (dec n) (* acc n)))))

(factorial 10)
;; ⇒ 3628800
```

<a id="trampoline_desc"></a>
### trampoline

```clojure
([f])
([f & args])
```

`trampoline` takes a function and a variable number of arguments to pass to that function.

`trampoline` allows for mutual recursion without consuming stack space proportional to the number of recursive calls made.

If the return value of that function is a function, `trampoline` calls that function with no arguments. If the return value is not a function, `trampoline` simply returns that value.

Since `trampoline` calls the returned functions with no arguments, you must supply an anonymous function that takes no arguments and calls the function you wish to recur to. This is usually done with anonymous function literals `#()`

```klipse-clojure
(declare count-up1 count-up2) ;; see `declare` for why this is needed

(defn count-up1
  [result start total]
  (if (= start total)
    result
    #(count-up2 (conj result start) (inc start) total))) ;; returns an anonymous function

(defn count-up2 [result start total]
  (if (= start total)
    result
    #(count-up1 (conj result start) (inc start) total))) ;; returns an anonymous function

;; delete #_ to run the example:
#_(trampoline count-up1 [] 0 10)
;; ⇒ [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
```

<a id="for_desc"></a>
### for

```clojure
([seq-exprs body-expr])
```

`for` takes a vector of pairs of [binding collection].

`for` allows for list comprehensions. `for`  assigns each sequential value in the collection to the binding form and evaluates them rightmost first. The results are returned in a lazy sequence.

`for` allows for explicit let, when and while through use of `:let []`, `:when (expression)`, and `:while (expression)` in the binding vector.

```klipse-clojure
(for [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]]
  [x y])
;; ⇒ ([1 4] [1 5] [1 6] [2 4] [2 5] [2 6] [3 4] [3 5] [3 6])
```

`:when` only evaluates the body when a truthy value is returned by the expression provided

```klipse-clojure
(for [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]
      :when (and
             (even? x)
             (odd? y))]
  [x y])
;; ⇒ ([2 5])
```

`:while` evaluates the body until a falsey value is reached. Note that elements of the second collection are bound to `y` before a falsey value of `(< x 2)` is reached in the following example. This demonstrates the order of the comprehension.

```klipse-clojure
(for [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]
      :while (< x 2)]
  [x y])
;; ⇒ ([1 4] [1 5] [1 6])
```

<a id="doseq_desc"></a>
### doseq

```clojure
([seq-exprs & body])
```

`doseq` takes a vector of pairs of `[binding collection]`
and then one or more expressions as the `body`.

`doseq` is similar to `for` except it does not return a sequence of results. `doseq` is generally intended for execution of side-effects in the body, and thus returns `nil`.

`doseq` supports the same bindings as for - `:let`, `:when`, `:while`. For examples of those, see `for` above.

```klipse-clojure
(doseq [x [1 2 3] y [4 5 6]]
  (println [x y]))

;; [1 4][1 5][1 6][2 4][2 5][2 6][3 4][3 5][3 6]
;; ⇒ nil
```

<a id="run_desc"></a>
### run!

```clojure
([proc coll])
```

If you have a single collection to loop over, just for side-effects,
and a single function to call on each element, you might prefer to use
`run!` instead of `doseq`. The following are equivalent:

```clojure
(doseq [x [1 2 3]]
  (println x))
(run! println [1 2 3])
```

<a id="iterate_desc"></a>
### iterate

```clojure
([f x])
```

`iterate` takes a function and an argument to the function.

A lazy sequence is returned consisting of the argument then each subsequent entry is the function evaluated with the previous entry in the lazy sequence. In other words, the function is applied repeatedly to produce each new entry in the sequence.

Since it is an infinite sequence, you need to use `take` or similar to get a finite number of elements.

```klipse-clojure
(take 10 (iterate inc 0))
;; ⇒ (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```

<a id="reduce_desc"></a>
### reduce

```clojure
([f coll])
([f val coll])
```

`reduce` takes a function, an optional initial value and a collection.

If an initial value is provided, `reduce` applies the function to that
initial value and the first item in the collection. The function is
then applied to that result and the second item in the collection, and
so on. If the collection is empty, the initial value is returned (and
the function is not called).

If an initial value is not provided, and the behavior is a bit more
complicated:
* If the collection is empty, the function is called with no arguments and the result is returned,
* If the collection has one element, that element is returned, and the function is not called,
* Otherwise, the function is called with the first two elements of the collection, and then with the result of that call and the third element, and so on.

```klipse-clojure
(reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5]) ; (+ 0 1) then (+ 1 2), (+ 3 3), (+ 6 4), (+ 10 5)
;; ⇒ 15
```
```klipse-clojure
(reduce + 0 []) ; 0 -- + is not called
;; ⇒ 0
```
```klipse-clojure
(reduce + [1 2 3 4 5]) ; (+ 1 2) then (+ 3 3), (+ 6 4), (+ 10 5)
;; ⇒ 15
```
```klipse-clojure
(reduce + [1]) ; 1 -- + is not called
;; ⇒ 1
```
```klipse-clojure
(reduce + []) ; 0 -- (+) is called and produces zero
;; ⇒ 0
```

<a id="reductions_desc"></a>
### reductions

```clojure
([f coll])
([f val coll])
```

`reductions` takes a function, an optional initial value and a collection.

`reductions` returns a lazy sequence of the intermediate values that would
be produced during calls to `reduce` with the same arguments.

Like `reduce`,
if no initial value is provided, and the collection is empty, the function
is called with no arguments and the result is the only value in the lazy
sequence; if no initial value is provided, and the collection has only one
element, that element is the only value in the lazy sequence, and the
function is not called.


<a id="map_desc"></a>
### map

```clojure
([f coll])
([f c1 c2])
([f c1 c2 c3])
([f c1 c2 c3 & colls])
```

`map` takes a function and one or more collections.  `map` passes an
item from each collection, in order, to the function and returns a
lazy sequence of the results.

The function provided to `map` must support an arity matching the
number of collections passed. Due to this, when using more than one
collection, `map` stops processing items when any collection runs out of
items.

<a id="mapv_desc"></a>
### mapv

```clojure
([f coll])
([f c1 c2])
([f c1 c2 c3])
([f c1 c2 c3 & colls])
```

`mapv` takes a function and one or more collections.  `mapv` passes an
item from each collection, in order, to the function and returns a
vector of the results. Unlike `map`, `mapv` is **not** lazy.

If `mapv`
is called with a single collection, it will use a transient vector to build
the result for efficiency.

If `mapv` is called with multiple collections, it will first call `map` on them
and then turn the result into a vector (using `into []`).

The function provided to `mapv` must support an arity matching the
number of collections passed. Due to this, when using more than one
collection, `mapv` stops processing items when any collection runs out of
items, like `map`.

## Collection and Sequence Modification

<a id="conj_desc"></a>
### conj

```clojure
([coll x])
([coll x & xs])
```

`conj` takes a collection and a variable number of arguments.

`conj` is short for "conjoin". As the name implies, `conj` returns the
collection with those arguments added.

Adding items to a collection occurs at different places depending on
the concrete type of collection.

List addition occurs at the beginning of the list. This is because
accessing the head of the list is a constant time operation, and
accessing the tail requires traversal of the entire list.

```clojure
(conj '(1 2) 3)
;; ⇒ (3 1 2)
```

Vectors have constant time access across the entire data
structure. `'conj' thusly appends to the end of a vector.

```klipse-clojure
(conj [1 2] 3)
;; ⇒ [1 2 3]
```

Maps do not have guaranteed ordering, so the location that items are
added is irrelevant. `conj` requires vectors of [key value] pairs to
be added to the map.

```klipse-clojure
(conj {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} [:d 4])
;; ⇒ {:d 4, :a 1, :c 3, :b 2}
```

```klipse-clojure
(conj {:cats 1 :dogs 2} [:ants 400] [:giraffes 13])
;; ⇒ {:giraffes 13, :ants 400, :cats 1, :dogs 2}
```

Sets also do not have guaranteed ordering. `conj` returns a set with
the item added. As the concept of sets implies, added items will not
duplicate equivalent items if they are present in the set.

```klipse-clojure
(conj #{1 4} 5)
;; ⇒ #{1 4 5}
```

```klipse-clojure
(conj #{:a :b :c} :b :c :d :e)
;; ⇒ #{:a :c :b :d :e}
```

<a id="empty_desc"></a>
### empty

```clojure
([coll])
```

`empty` takes a collection

`empty` returns an empty collection of the same type as the collection
provided.

```klipse-clojure
(empty [1 2 3])
;; ⇒ []
```

```klipse-clojure
(empty {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
;; ⇒ {}
```

<a id="assoc_desc"></a>
### assoc

```clojure
([map key val])
([map key val & kvs])
```

`assoc` takes a key and a value and returns a collection of the same
type as the supplied collection with the key mapped to the new value.

`assoc` is similar to get in how it works with maps, records or
vectors. When applied to a map or record, the same type is returned
with the key/value pairs added or modified.  When applied to a vector,
a vector is returned with the key acting as an index and the index
being replaced by the value.

Since maps and records can not contain multiple equivalent keys,
supplying `assoc` with a key/value that exists in the one will cause
`assoc` to return modify the key at that value in the result and not
duplicate the key.

```klipse-clojure
(assoc {:a 1} :b 2)
;; ⇒ {:b 2, :a 1}
```

```klipse-clojure
(assoc {:a 1 :b 45 :c 3} :b 2)
;; ⇒ {:a 1, :c 3, :b 2}
```

```klipse-clojure
(defrecord Hand [index middle ring pinky thumb])
(assoc (Hand. 3 4 3.5 2 2) :index 3.75)
;; ⇒ #user.Hand{:index 3.75, :middle 4, :ring 3.5, :pinky 2, :thumb 2}
```

When using `assoc` with a vector, the key is
the index and the value is the value to assign to that index in the
returned vector.  The key must be <= (count vector) or a
"IndexOutOfBoundsException" will occur. `assoc` can not be used to add
an item to a vector.

```klipse-clojure
(assoc [1 2 76] 2 3) ;= [1 2 3]
```

```klipse-clojure
;; index 5 does not exist. valid indexes for this vector are: 0, 1, 2
(assoc [1 2 3] 5 6)
;; IndexOutOfBoundsException   clojure.lang.PersistentVector.assocN (PersistentVector.java:136)
```

<a id="dissoc_desc"></a>
### dissoc

```clojure
([map])
([map key])
([map key & ks])
```

`dissoc` takes a map and a variable number of keys.

`dissoc` returns a map with the supplied keys, and subsequently their
values, removed. Unlike `assoc`, `dissoc` does not work on
vectors. When a record is provided, `dissoc` returns a map. For
similar functionality with vectors, see `subvec` and `concat`.

```klipse-clojure
(dissoc {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :b)
;; ⇒ {:a 1, :c 3}
```

```klipse-clojure
(dissoc {:a 1 :b 14 :c 390 :d 75 :e 2 :f 51} :b :c :e)
;; ⇒ {:a 1, :f 51, :d 75}
```

```klipse-clojure
;; note that a map is returned, not a record.
(defrecord Hand [index middle ring pinky thumb])
;; always be careful with the bandsaw!
(dissoc (Hand. 3 4 3.5 2 2) :ring)
;; ⇒ {:index 3, :middle 4, :pinky 2, :thumb 2}
```

## Information about a Collection or Sequence

<a id="count_desc"></a>
### count

```clojure
([coll])
```

`count` takes a collection.

Returns a count of the number of items in a collection. An argument of nil returns 0.

```klipse-clojure
(count "Hello")
;; ⇒ 5
```

```klipse-clojure
(count [1 2 3 4 5 6 7])
;; ⇒ 7
```

```klipse-clojure
(count nil)
;; ⇒ 0
```

Note that count does not return in constant time for all
collections. This can be determined with `counted?`.  Keep in mind
that lazy sequences must be realized to get a count of the items. This
is often not intended and can cause a variety of otherwise cryptic
errors.

```klipse-clojure
(counted? "Hello")
;; ⇒ false
```

```klipse-clojure
;; will be fully realized when using (count (range 10))
(counted? (range 10))
;; ⇒ false
```

```klipse-clojure
;; Constant time return of (count)
(counted? [1 2 3 4 5])
;; ⇒ true
```
<a id="empty?_desc"></a>
### empty?

```clojure
([coll])
```

`empty` takes a collection.

`empty?` returns true if the collection has no items, or false if it has 1 or more items.

```klipse-clojure
(empty? [])
;; ⇒ true
```

```klipse-clojure
(empty? '(1 2 3))
;; ⇒ false
```

Do not confuse `empty?` with `empty`. This can be a source of great confusion:

```klipse-clojure
(if (empty [1 2 3]) ;; empty returns an empty seq, which is true! use empty? here.
  "It's empty"
  "It's not empty")
;; ⇒ "It's empty"
```

<a id="not-empty_desc"></a>
### not-empty

```clojure
([coll])
```

`not-empty` takes a collection.

`not-empty` returns nil if the collection has no items. If the collection contains items, the collection is returned.

```klipse-clojure
(not-empty '(:mice :elephants :children))
;; ⇒ (:mice :elephants :children)
```

```klipse-clojure
(not-empty '())
;; ⇒ nil
```

## Items in a Collection or Sequence

<a id="first_desc"></a>
### first

```clojure
([coll])
```

`first` takes a collection.

`first` returns the first item in the collection. `first` returns nil
if the argument is empty or is nil.

Note that for collections that do not guarantee order like some maps
and sets, the behaviour of `first` should not be relied on.

```klipse-clojure
(first (range 10))
;; ⇒ 0
```

```klipse-clojure
(first [:floor :piano :seagull])
;; ⇒ :floor
```

```klipse-clojure
(first [])
;; ⇒ nil
```

<a id="rest_desc"></a>
### rest

```clojure
([coll])
```

`rest` takes a collection.

`rest` returns a seq of items starting with the second element in the
collection. `rest` returns an empty seq if the collection only
contains a single item.

`rest` should also not be relied on when using maps and sets unless
you are sure ordering is guaranteed.

```klipse-clojure
(rest [13 1 16 -4])
;; ⇒ (1 16 -4)
```

```klipse-clojure
(rest '(:french-fry))
;; ⇒ '()
```

The behaviour of `rest` should be contrasted with `next`. `next` returns `nil` if the collection only has a single item. This is important when considering "truthiness" of values since an empty seq is still a truthy value but `nil` is not.

```klipse-clojure
(if (rest '("stuff"))
  (print "Does this print?")) ;; yes, it prints.
```


```clojure
;; NEVER FINISHES EXECUTION!
;; "done" is never reached because (rest x) is always a "true" value
(defn inf
  [x]
  (if (rest x)
    (inf (rest x))
    "done"))
```

<a id="get_desc"></a>
### get

```clojure
([map key])
([map key not-found])
```

`get` takes an associative collection, a sequence of keys and an optional default value.

`get` returns the value for the specified key in a map or record,
index of a vector or value in a set. If the key is not present, `get`
returns nil or a supplied default value.

```klipse-clojure
;; val of a key in a map
(get {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :b)
;; ⇒ 2
```

```klipse-clojure
;; index of a vector
(get [10 15 20 25] 2)
;; ⇒ 20
```

```klipse-clojure
;; in a set, returns the value itself if present
(get #{1 10 100 2 20 200} 1)
;; ⇒ 1
```

```klipse-clojure
;; returns nil if key is not present
(get {:a 1 :b 2} :c)
;; ⇒ nil
```

```klipse-clojure
;; vector does not have an _index_ of 4. nil is returned
(get [1 2 3 4] 4)
;; ⇒ nil
```

```klipse-clojure
(defrecord Hand [index middle ring pinky thumb])
(get (Hand. 3 4 3.5 2 2) :index)
;; ⇒ 3
```

`get` also supports a default return value supplied as the last argument.

```klipse-clojure
;; index 4 does not exist. return default value
(get [1 2 3 4] 4 "Not Found")
;; ⇒ "Not Found"
```

```klipse-clojure
;; key :c does not exist, so return default value of 3
(get {:a 1 :b 2} :c 3)
;; ⇒ 3
```

<a id="contains?_desc"></a>
### contains?

```clojure
([coll key])
```

`contains?` takes a collection and a key.

`contains` returns true if the provided *key* is present in a
collection. `contains` is similar to `get` in that vectors treat the
key as an index. `contains` will always return false for lists.

```klipse-clojure
(contains? {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :c)
;; ⇒ true
```

```klipse-clojure
;; true if index 2 exists
(contains? ["John" "Mary" "Paul"] 2)
;; ⇒ true
```

```klipse-clojure
;; false if index 5 does not exist
(contains? ["John" "Mary" "Paul"] 5)
;; ⇒ false
```

```klipse-clojure
;; "Paul" does not exist as an index
(contains? ["John" "Mary" "Paul"] "Paul")
;; ⇒ false
```

```klipse-clojure
;; lists are not supported. contains? won't traverse a collection for a result.
(contains? '(1 2 3) 0) ; false in ClojureScript, an exception in Clojure
```

<a id="keys_desc"></a>
### keys

```clojure
([map])
```

`keys` takes a map or record.

`keys` returns a sequence of the keys in a map or record.

```klipse-clojure
(keys {1 "one" 2 "two" 3 "three"})
;; ⇒ (1 2 3)
```

```klipse-clojure
(defrecord Hand [index middle ring pinky thumb])
(keys (Hand. 2 4 3 1 2))
;; ⇒ (:index :middle :ring :pinky :thumb)
```

<a id="vals_desc"></a>
### vals

```clojure
([map])
```

`vals` takes a map or record.

`vals` returns a sequence of vals in a map or record.

```klipse-clojure
(vals {:meows 20 :barks 2 :moos 5})
;; ⇒ (5 2 20)
```

```klipse-clojure
(defrecord Hand [index middle ring pinky thumb])
(vals (Hand. 1 2 3 4 5))
;; ⇒ (1 2 3 4 5)
```

<a id="take_desc"></a>
### take

```clojure
([n coll])
```

`take` takes a number and a collection.

`take` returns a lazy sequence starting with the first value of the
collection and n sequential items after that.

If the number of items in the collection is less than the provided
number, the entire collection is returned lazily.

<a id="drop_desc"></a>
### drop

```clojure
([n coll])
```

`drop` takes a number and a collection.

`drop` returns a lazy sequence starting at the nth item of the collection.

<a id="take-while_desc"></a>
### take-while

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

`take-while` takes a function that accepts a single-argument and a
collection.

`take-while` returns a lazy sequence of sequential items until the
function returns nil/false value for that item.

```klipse-clojure
(take-while pos? (range 5 -5 -1))
;; => (5 4 3 2 1)
```

<a id="drop-while_desc"></a>
### drop-while

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

'drop-while` takes a function that accepts a single-argument and a
collection.

`drop-while` returns a lazy sequence starting at the first item in the
collection that the function returns nil/false.

<a id="filter_desc"></a>
### filter

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

`filter` takes a function that accepts a single argument and a
collection.

`filter` returns a lazy sequence of items for which the
provided predicate produces a truthy value. Contrast to `remove`.

```klipse-clojure
(filter even? (range 10))
;; ⇒ (0 2 4 6 8)
```

```klipse-clojure
(filter #(if (< (count %) 5) %) ["Paul" "Celery" "Computer" "Rudd" "Tayne"])
;; ⇒ ("Paul" "Rudd")
```

When using sets with `filter`, remember that if `nil` or `false` is in the
set and in the collection, then the predicate will return falsey and the item
will be omitted.

```klipse-clojure
(filter #{:nothing :something nil false} [:nothing :something :things :someone nil false :pigeons])
;; ⇒ (:nothing :something)
```

<a id="filterv_desc"></a>
### filterv

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

`filterv` takes a function that accepts a single argument and a
collection.

`filterv` returns a vector of items for which the
provided predicate produces a truthy value. Contrast to `remove`.

```klipse-clojure
(filterv even? (range 10))
;; ⇒ [0 2 4 6 8]
```

```klipse-clojure
(filterv #(if (< (count %) 5) %) ["Paul" "Celery" "Computer" "Rudd" "Tayne"])
;; ⇒ ["Paul" "Rudd"]
```

When using sets with `filterv`, remember that if `nil` or `false` is in the
set and in the collection, then the predicate will return falsey and the item
will be omitted.

```klipse-clojure
(filterv #{:nothing :something nil false} [:nothing :something :things :someone nil false :pigeons])
;; ⇒ [:nothing :something]
```

<a id="keep_desc"></a>
### keep

`(keep f coll)`

`keep` takes a function that accepts a single argument and a
collection.

`keep` returns a lazy sequence of non-nil results of the function
applied to each item in the collection in sequence.

```klipse-clojure
;; naive attempt: returns a sequence of true/false
(keep even? (range 10))
;; => (true false true false true false true false true false)
```

```klipse-clojure
;; return even? item or nil:
(keep #(when (even? %) %) (range 10))
;; => (0 2 4 6 8)
```

```klipse-clojure
(keep not-empty ["" "Sean" "" "Corfield" ""])
;; => ("Sean" "Corfield")
```

<a id="remove_desc"></a>
### remove

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

`remove` takes a function that accepts a single argument and a
collection.

`remove` returns a lazy sequence of items that return `false` or `nil`
for the provided predicate. Contrast to `filter`.

```klipse-clojure
(remove even? (range 10))
;; ⇒ (1 3 5 7 9)
```

```klipse-clojure
;; relative complement. probably useless?
(remove {:a 1 :b 2} [:h :k :z :b :s])
;; ⇒ (:h :k :z :s)
```

When using sets with `remove`, remember that if nil or false is in the
set and in the collection, then the predicate will return itself:
`nil`.  This will cause that item to be included in the returned lazy
sequence.

In this example, when nil and false are tested with the predicate, the
predicate returns nil. This is because if the item is present in the
set it is returned.

```klipse-clojure
(remove #{:nothing :something nil} [:nothing :something :things :someone nil false :pigeons])
;; ⇒ (:things :someone nil false :pigeons)
```


<a id="some_desc"></a>
### some

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

`some` takes a function that accepts a single argument and a collection.

`some` will apply a predicate to each value in a collection until a
non-false/nil result is returned then immediately return that result.

Since collections are "true" values, this makes it possible to return
the first result itself rather than simply `true`.

```klipse-clojure
(some even? [1 2 3 4 5])
;; ⇒ true
```

```klipse-clojure
;; predicate returns the value rather than simply true
(some #(if (even? %) %) [1 2 3 4 5])
;; ⇒ 2
```

Since maps can be used as functions, you can use a map as a
predicate. This will return the value of the first key in the
collection that is also in the map.

```klipse-clojure
(some {:a 1 :b 5} [:h :k :d :b])
;; ⇒ 5
```

Sets can also be used as functions and will return the first item in
the collection that is present in the set.

```klipse-clojure
(some #{4} (range 20))
;; ⇒ 4
```

<a id="every?_desc"></a>
### every?

```clojure
([pred coll])
```

`every?` takes a function that accepts a single argument and a collection.

`every?` returns true if the predicate returns true for every item in
the collection, otherwise it returns false.

```klipse-clojure
(every? even? (range 0 10 2))
;; ⇒ true
```

```klipse-clojure
;; set can be used to see if collection only contains items in the set.
(every? #{2 3 4} [2 3 4 2 3 4])
;; ⇒ true
```

## Processing Collections and Sequences

<a id="partition_desc"></a>
### partition

```clojure
([n coll])
([n step coll])
([n step pad coll])
```

`partition` takes a number, an optional step, an optional padding
collection and a collection. If the padding collection is provided, a
step must be provided.

`partition` sequentially takes a provided number of items from the
collection in sequence and puts them into lists. This lazy sequence of
lists is returned.

If a step is provided, the lists in the returned lazy sequence start
at offsets in the provided collection of that number items in the
list.

If a padding collection is provided, the last item in the returned
lazy sequence will be padded with the padding collection to achieve
the desired partitioning size.

If there is no padding collection provided and there is not enough
items to fill the last list in the returned lazy sequence, those items
will be not used.

```klipse-clojure
;; divide the sequence into pairs, the value 4 is dropped:
(partition 2 (range 5))
;; => ((0 1) (2 3))
```

```klipse-clojure
;; staggered pairs can be useful (and the value 4 is included):
(partition 2 1 (range 5))
;; => ((0 1) (1 2) (2 3) (3 4))
```

```klipse-clojure
;; divide the sequence into pairs and pad the last pair with -1:
(partition 2 2 [-1] (range 5))
;; => ((0 1) (2 3) (4 -1))
```

<a id="partitionv_desc"></a>
### partitionv

```clojure
([n coll])
([n step coll])
([n step pad coll])
```

`partitionv` is just like `partition` above, except it returns a
lazy sequence of vectors instead of a lazy sequence of lists.

<a id="partition-all_desc"></a>
### partition-all

```clojure
([n coll])
([n step coll])
```

`partition-all` takes a number, an optional step and a collection.

`partition-all` sequentially takes a provided number of items from the
collection in sequence and puts them into lists. This lazy sequence of
lists is returned.

If a step is provided, the lists in the returned lazy sequence start
at offsets in the provided collection of that number items in the
list.

If there are not enough items to fill the last list in the returned
lazy sequence, the remaining items will be used in the last list.

```klipse-clojure
;; divide the sequence into pairs, the value 4 is not dropped:
(partition-all 2 (range 5))
;; => ((0 1) (2 3) (4))
```

<a id="partitionv-all_desc"></a>
### partitionv-all

```clojure
([n coll])
([n step coll])
```

`partitionv-all` is just like `partition-all` above, except it returns a
lazy sequence of vectors instead of a lazy sequence of lists.

## Function Composition and Application

<a id="juxt_desc"></a>
### juxt

```clojure
([])
([f])
([f g])
([f g h])
([f1 f2 f3 & fs])
```

`juxt` takes a variable number of functions.

`juxt` returns a function that will return a vector consisting of the
result of applying each of those functions to a provided argument.

```klipse-clojure
;; turn a sequence of database rows into a map from ID to row:
(into {} (map (juxt :id identity)) [{:id 1 :name "Sean"} {:id 2 :name "Jay"}])
```

<a id="comp_desc"></a>
### comp

```clojure
([])
([f])
([f g])
([f g h])
([f1 f2 f3 & fs])
```

`comp` takes a variable number of functions.

`comp` returns a function that will return the result of applying the
rightmost function to the provided argument, then the second rightmost
function to the result of that etc.

```clojure
(let [cf (comp f g h)]
  (cf x)) ; the same as (f (g (h x)))
```


<a id="fnil_desc"></a>
### fnil

```clojure
([f x])
([f x y])
([f x y z])
```

`fnil` takes a function and one to three arguments.

`fnil` returns a function that replaces any `nil`` arguments with the
provided values. `fnil` only supports supports patching 3 arguments,
but will pass any arguments beyond that un-patched.

```klipse-clojure
(defn say-info [name location hobby]
  (println name "is from" location "and enjoys" hobby))

(def say-info-patched (fnil say-info "Someone" "an unknown location" "Clojure"))

(say-info-patched nil nil nil)
;; ⇒ Someone is from an unknown location and enjoys Clojure
```

```klipse-clojure
(say-info-patched "Robert" nil "giraffe migrations")
;; ⇒ Robert is from an unknown location and enjoys giraffe migrations
```

<a id="apply_desc"></a>
### apply

```clojure
([f args] [f x args] [f x y args] [f x y z args] [f a b c d & args])
```

`apply` takes a variable number of arguments and a collection.

`apply` effectively unrolls the supplied args and a collection into a
list of arguments to the supplied function.

```klipse-clojure
(str ["Hel" "lo"])
;; ⇒ "[\"Hel\" \"lo\"]" ;; not what we want, str is operating on the vector
```

```klipse-clojure
(apply str ["Hel" "lo"]) ;; same as (str "Hel" "lo")
;; ⇒ "Hello"
```

`apply` prepends any supplied arguments to the form as well.

```klipse-clojure
(map + [[1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) ;; This attempts to add 2 vectors with +
;; ClassCastException   java.lang.Class.cast (Class.java:2990)
```

```klipse-clojure
(apply map + [[1 2 3] [1 2 3]]) ;; same as (map + [1 2 3] [1 2 3])
;; ⇒ (2 4 6)
```

```klipse-clojure
(apply + 1 2 3 [4 5 6]) ;; same as  (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6)
;; ⇒ 21
```

Note that apply can not be used with macros.

<a id="-gt_desc"></a>
### ->

```clojure
([x])
([x form])
([x form & more])
```

`->` takes a value and optionally one or more expressions.

`->` takes the first argument and inserts it as the second item in the
next form, or creates a list with the first argument as the second
item. The return value of that expression is inserted as the second
item in the next form, making a list if necessary.  This continues
until all expressions are evaluated and the final value is returned.

```clojure
(-> 5
    (inc)
    (- 3)
    (* 2))
;; ⇒ 6
(-> {:a 1 :b 2}
    :b
    (inc))
;; ⇒ 3
```



<a id="-gtgt_desc"></a>
### ->>

```clojure
([x])
([x form])
([x form & more])
```

`->>` takes a value and optionally one or more expressions.

`->>` takes the first argument and inserts it as the last item in the
next form, or creates a list with the first argument as the last
item. The return value of that expression is inserted as the last item
in the next form, making a list if necessary.  This continues until
all expressions are evaluated and the final value is returned.

```clojure
(->> (range 5) ; (0 1 2 3 4)
     (map inc) ; (1 2 3 4 5)
     (filter even?) ; (2 4)
     (reduce +)) ; (+ 2 4)
;; ⇒ 6
```


## Associative Collections

<a id="get-in_desc"></a>
### get-in

```clojure
([m ks] [m ks not-found])
```

`get-in` takes an associative collection, a sequence of keys and an optional default value.

`get-in` takes the first value in the sequence of keys and retrieves
the value, then applies each subsequent key to to the most recently
returned value and returns the final result. If any key is not present
when evaluated then either nil, or a provided default value is
returned.

```klipse-clojure
(get-in {:profile {:personal {:age 28}}} [:profile :personal :age])
;= 28
```



<a id="update-in_desc"></a>
### update-in

```clojure
([m [k & ks] f & args])
```

`update-in` takes an associative collection, a sequence of keys, a
function and optional arguments to supply to that function.

`update-in` takes the first value in the sequence of keys and
retrieves the value, then applies each subsequent key to to the most
recently returned value. The function and optional arguments are
applied to the value and a new nested collection is returned with the
key having the result of that function.

`update-in` will create new hash-maps if a key in the sequence of keys
does not exist. The returned collection will have a nested structure
correlating to the provided sequence along with the result of the
function and optional arguments as the value of the final key.

```klipse-clojure
(update-in {:profile {:personal {:age 28}}} [:profile :personal :age] inc)
;= {:profile {:personal {:age 29}}}
```



<a id="assoc-in_desc"></a>
### assoc-in

```clojure
([m [k & ks] v])
```

`assoc-in` takes an associative collection, a sequence of keys and a value.

`assoc-in` takes the first value in the sequence of keys and retrieves
the value, then applies each subsequent key to to the most recently
returned value. The final key is assigned the provided value and a new
nested collection is returned.

`assoc-in` will create new hash-maps if a key in the sequence of keys
does not exist. The returned collection will have a nested structure
correlating to the provided sequence along with the provided value as
the value of the final key.

```klipse-clojure
(assoc-in {:profile {:personal {:age 28}}} [:profile :personal :location] "Vancouver, BC")
;= {:profile {:personal {:location "Vancouver, BC", :age 28}}}
```



<a id="select-keys_desc"></a>
### select-keys

```clojure
([map keyseq])
```

`select-keys` takes an associative collection and a sequence of keys.

`select-keys` returns a map containing only the entries that have a
key which is also present in the sequence of keys.

```klipse-clojure
(select-keys {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} [:a :b])
;= {:b 2, :a 1}
```
