project. It describes concepts that are simple but may seem foreign at first.
These concepts are some of the key points of Clojure
design. Understanding them may take some time for folks without
a concurrent programming background. Don't let this learning curve
discourage you.</p><p>If some parts are not clear, please ask for clarification <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/clojure">on the
mailing
list</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-doc/clojure-doc.github.io/issues">file an issue</a> on GitHub.
We will work hard on making this guide easy to follow with edits and
images to illustrate the concepts.</p><h2 id="introduction-and-terminology">Introduction and Terminology</h2><p>Before we get to the Clojure features related to concurrency, lets lay a foundation and briefly
cover some terminology.</p><table class="table-striped table-bordered table"><thead><tr><th>Term</th><th>Definition This Guide Uses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Concurrency</td><td>When multiple threads are making progress, whether it is via time-slicing or parallelism</td></tr><tr><td>Parallelism</td><td>A condition that arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously, e.g., on multiple cores or CPUs.</td></tr><tr><td>Shared State</td><td>When multiple threads of execution need to mutate (modify) one or more pieces of program state (e.g., variables, identities)</td></tr><tr><td>Mutable Data Structures</td><td>Data structures that, when changed, are updated "in place"</td></tr><tr><td>Immutable Data Structures</td><td>Data structures that, when changed, produce new data structures (copies), possibly with optimizations such as internal structural sharing</td></tr><tr><td>Concurrency Hazards</td><td>Conditions that occur in concurrent programs that prevent program from being correct (behaving the way its authors intended).</td></tr><tr><td>Shared Mutable State</td><td>When shared state is made of mutable data structures. A ripe ground for concurrency hazards.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are many concurrency hazards, some of the most common and well known are:</p><table class="table-striped table-bordered table"><thead><tr><th>Concurrency Hazard</th><th>Brief Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Race Condition</td><td>A condition when the outcome is dependent on timing or relative ordering of events</td></tr><tr><td>Deadlock</td><td>When two or more threads are waiting on each other to finish or release a shared resource, thus waiting forever and not making any progress</td></tr><tr><td>Livelock</td><td>When two or more threads are technically performing computation but not doing any useful work (not making progress), for example,
          because they endlessly pass a piece of data to each other but never actually process it</td></tr><tr><td>Starvation</td><td>When a thread is not given regular access to a shared resource and cannot make progress.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These hazards are not exclusive to threads and can happen with OS
processes, runtime processes and any other execution processes. They
are also not specific to a particular runtime or VM (e.g., the JVM) or
programming language. Admittedly, some languages make it significantly
easier to write correct, safe concurrent programs, but none are
completely immune to concurrency hazards. More often than not,
concurrency hazards are algorithmic problems, languages just encourage
or discourage certain practices and techniques.</p><p><em>Thread-safe</em> code is code that is always executed correctly and does
not suffer from concurrency hazards even when executed concurrently
from multiple threads.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p>One of Clojure design goals was to make concurrent programming
easier. The thinking is that as modern CPUs add more and more cores
and the number of CPUs is increasing as well, the biggest contributor
to application throughput will come from making use of those
resources.</p><p>The key design decision was making Clojure data structures immutable
(persistent) and separating the concepts of <em>identity</em> and
<em>value</em>. The importance of immutability cannot be over-emphasized:
immutable values can be safely shared between threads, eliminate many
concurrency hazards, and ultimately make it easier for developers to
reason about their programs.</p><p>However, a language that only has immutable data structures and no way
to change (mutate) program state is not very useful. The
identity/value separation makes state mutations (e.g., incrementing a
counter or adding an element to a list) possible in ways that
have known guarantees with respect to concurrency. This separation largely
eliminates the need for explicit use of locks, which is possible in Clojure
but typically not necessary.</p><p>To put it another way: "changing variables" in Clojure happens
differently from many other languages; in ways that are predictable
from the concurrency perspective and which eliminate many concurrency hazards.</p><p>Next lets take a closer look to the identity/value separation.</p><h2 id="identityvalue-separation-on-state-and-identity">Identity/Value Separation ("on State and Identity")</h2><p>In Clojure, <em>values</em> are immutable. They never change. For example, a number is a value.
A map <code>{:language "Clojure"}</code> is a value. A vector with 3 elements is a value.</p><p>When you attempt to modify a value (a data structure), a new value is produced instead. These
are known as <em>persistent data structures</em> (the word "persistent" has nothing to do with
storing data on disk).</p><p>An <em>identity</em> is a named entity (e.g., a list of active chat group
members or a counter) that changes over time and at any given moment references a value.
For example, the current value of a counter may be <code>42</code>. After incrementing it, the value
is <code>43</code> but it is still the same counter --- the same identity. This is different from, say, Java
or Ruby, where variables serve as identities that (typically) point to a mutable value
and which are modified in place.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/language/concurrency_and_parallelism/identity_value.png" alt="identity_value" /></p><p>Identities in Clojure can be of several types, known as <em>reference types</em>.</p><h2 id="clojure-reference-types">Clojure Reference Types</h2><h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3><p>In Clojure's world view, concurrent operations can be roughly
classified as coordinated or uncoordinated, and synchronous or
asynchronous. Different reference types in Clojure have their own
concurrency semantics and cover different kind of operations:</p><table class="table-bordered table"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Coordinated</th><th>Uncoordinated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Synchronous</td><td><a href="#refs">Refs</a></td><td><a href="#atoms">Atoms</a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;">Asynchronous</td><td>—</td><td><a href="#agents">Agents</a></td></tr></tbody></table><dl><dt>Coordinated</dt><dd>An operation that depends on cooperation from other operations (possibly, other operations at least do not interfere with it)
      in order to produce correct results. For example, a banking operation that involves more than one account.
   </dd><dt>Uncoordinated</dt><dd>An operation that does not affect other operations in any way. For example, when downloading 100 Web pages concurrently,
      each operation does not affect the others.
  </dd><dt>Synchronous</dt><dd>When the caller's thread waits, blocks, or sleeps until it has access to a given resource or context.</dd><dt>Asynchronous</dt><dd>Operations that can be started or scheduled without blocking the caller's thread.</dd></dl><p>One more reference type, <a href="#vars">vars</a>, supports dynamic scoping and thread-local storage.</p><h3 id="atoms">Atoms</h3><p>Atoms are references that change atomically (changes become immediately visible to all threads,
changes are guaranteed to be synchronized by the JVM). If you come from a Java background,
atoms are basically atomic references from <code>java.util.concurrent</code> with a functional twist
to them. Atoms are identities that implement synchronous, uncoordinated, atomic updates.</p><p>Lets jump right in and demonstrate how atoms work using an example. We know that Clojure data
structures are immutable by default. Adding an element to a collection really produces a new
collection. In such case, how does one keep a shared list (say, of active connections to a server
or recently crawled URLs) and mutate it in a thread-safe manner? We will demonstrate how to
accomplish this with an atom.</p><p>To create an atom, use the <code>clojure.core/atom</code> function. Its argument will serve as the atom's
initial value:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def currently-connected (atom []))
</code></pre><p>The line above makes the atom <code>currently-connected</code> an empty vector. To access an atom's value, use
<code>clojure.core/deref</code> or the <code>@atom</code> reader form:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def currently-connected (atom []))

@currently-connected
;; ⇒ []
(deref currently-connected)
;; ⇒ []
currently-connected
;; ⇒ #&lt;Atom@614b6b5d: []&gt;
</code></pre><p>As the returned values demonstrate, the atom itself is a reference. To
access its current value, you <em>dereference</em> it. Dereferencing will be
covered in more detail later in this guide. For now, it is sufficient
to say that dereferencing returns the current value of an atom. (Other
Clojure reference types as well as a few specialized data structures
can be dereferenced as well.)</p><p>Locals can be atoms, too:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(let [xs (atom [])]
  @xs)
;; ⇒ []
</code></pre><p>Now to the most interesting part: adding elements to the collection.</p><p>To mutate an atom, we can use <code>clojure.core/swap!</code>.</p><p><code>swap!</code> takes an atom, a function and optionally some other args, swaps the current value of the atom to be the return value of calling the function with the current value of the atom and the args:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(swap! currently-connected conj "chatty-joe")
;; ⇒ ["chatty-joe"]
currently-connected
;; ⇒ #&lt;Atom@614b6b5d: ["chatty-joe"]&gt;
@currently-connected
;; ⇒ ["chatty-joe"]
</code></pre><p>To demonstrate this graphically, initial atom state looks like this:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/language/concurrency_and_parallelism/atom_state1.png" alt="Atom state 1" /></p><p>and then we mutated it with <code>swap!</code>:</p><p><img src="/assets/images/language/concurrency_and_parallelism/atom_state2.png" alt="Atom state 2" /></p><p>For the readers familiar with the atomic types from the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html">java.util.concurrent.atomic</a> package,
this should sound very familiar. The only difference is that instead of setting a value, atoms are mutated
with a function. This is both because Clojure is a functional language and because with this approach,
<code>clojure.core/swap!</code> can <em>retry the operation</em> safely. This implies that the function you provide to
<code>swap!</code> is <em>pure</em> (has no side effects).</p><p>Occasionally you will need to mutate the value of an atom the same way you would with atomic references in Java:
by setting them to a specific value. This is what <code>clojure.core/reset!</code> does. It takes an atom and the new value:</p><pre><code class="clojure">@currently-connected
;; ⇒ ["chatty-joe"]
(reset! currently-connected [])
;; ⇒ []
@currently-connected
;; ⇒ []
</code></pre><p><code>reset!</code> may be useful in test suites to reset an atom's state between test executions, but it should be
used sparingly in your implementation code. Consider using <code>swap!</code> first.</p><p><em>TBD: demonstrate retries under high update rates</em></p><h4 id="summary-and-use-cases">Summary and Use Cases</h4><p>Atoms is the most commonly used concurrent feature in Clojure. It covers many cases and lets developers
avoid explicit locking. Atoms cover a lot of use cases and are very fast. It's fair to say that
when you need uncoordinated reference types (e.g., not Software Transactional Memory), the rule of
thumb is, "start with an atom, then see".</p><p>It is not uncommon to initialize an atom in a local and then return it from the function and share
a piece of state with other functions and/or threads.</p><h3 id="agents">Agents</h3><p>Agents are references that are updated asynchronously: updates happen at a later, unknown point
in time, in a thread pool. Agents are identities that implement uncoordinated, asynchronous updates.</p><p>A small but useful example of using an agent is as a counter. For
example, suppose we want to track how often page downloads in a Web
crawler respond with 40x and 50x status codes. The simplest version
can look like this:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def errors-counter (agent 0))
;; ⇒ #'user/errors-counter
errors-counter
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@6a6287b2: 0&gt;
@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 0
(deref errors-counter)
;; ⇒ 0
</code></pre><p>One can immediately make several observations: just like atoms, agents are references. To get
the current value of an agent, we need to <em>dereference</em> it using <code>clojure.core/deref</code> or
the <code>@agent</code> reader macro.</p><p>To mutate an agent, we use <code>clojure.core/send</code> and <code>clojure.core/send-off</code>:</p><pre><code class="clojure">@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 0
(send errors-counter inc)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@6a6287b2: 0&gt;
@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 1

;; 10 is an additional parameter. The + function will be invoked as `(+ @errors-counter 10)`.
(send errors-counter + 10)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@6a6287b2: 1&gt;
@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 11
</code></pre><p><code>send</code> and <code>send-off</code> are largely similar. The difference is in how they are implemented. <code>send</code> uses a
fixed-size thread pool so using blocking operations with it won't yield good throughput. <code>send-off</code>
uses a growing thread-pool so blocking operations is not a problem for it as long as there are resources
available to the JVM to create and run all the threads. On a 4-8 GB machine with 4 cores and stock
OS settings you can expect up to a couple of thousand I/O-bound threads to work without running
the system out of kernel resources.</p><h4 id="using-custom-executors-with-agents">Using Custom Executors With Agents</h4><p>Agents can be used (and abused) for arbitrary code execution in a thread pool. Because the default
thread pool Clojure maintains will not be a good fit for all use cases, Clojure 1.5 introduced
a function that lets you control what thread pool (executor) is used by <code>clojure.core/send</code>:
<code>clojure.core/set-agent-send-executor!</code>.</p><pre><code class="clojure">(import java.util.concurrent.Executors)

(set-agent-send-executor! (Executors/newFixedThreadPool 32))
;; clojure.core/send now will use the fixed size thread pool with 32 threads
</code></pre><p>The default thread pool size is <code>number of available CPU cores + 2</code>.</p><p><code>clojure.core/set-agent-send-off-executor!</code> is a similar function that controls what
thread pool <code>clojure.core/send-off</code> will use.</p><p>Finally, another new function in 1.5 is <code>clojure.core/send-via</code> which is like `` but lets you specify
an executor to be used on a case-by-case basis:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(import java.util.concurrent.Executors)

(def custom-pool (Executors/newFixedThreadPool 32))
;; just like clojure.core/send but will use custom-pool instead
;; of an internally maintained one
(send-via custom-pool stream-agent inc)
</code></pre><h3 id="agents-and-software-transactional-memory">Agents and Software Transactional Memory</h3><p>We haven't introduced refs and the concept of Software Transactional Memory yet. It will be covered later in this
guide. Here it's sufficient to mention that agents are STM-aware and can be safely used inside transactions.</p><h3 id="agents-and-error-handling">Agents and Error Handling</h3><p>Functions that modify an agent's state will not always return successfully in the real world. Sometimes they
will fail. For example:</p><pre><code class="clojure">@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 11
(send errors-counter / 0)
;; Evaluation aborted.
;; ⇒ nil
</code></pre><p>This puts the agent into the <em>failed</em> state. Failed agents will re-raise the exception that caused them
to fail every time their state changed is attempted:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(send errors-counter / 0)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@6a6287b2: 10&gt;
(send errors-counter inc)
;; Evaluation aborted.
</code></pre><p>To access the exception that occured during the agent's state mutation, use <code>clojure.core/agent-error</code>:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(send errors-counter / 0)
;; Evaluation aborted.
;; ⇒ nil
(agent-error errors-counter)
;; ⇒ #&lt;ArithmeticException java.lang.ArithmeticException: Divide by zero&gt;
</code></pre><p>It returns an exception. Agents can be restarted with <code>clojure.core/restart-agent</code> that takes an agent
and a new initial value:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(restart-agent errors-counter 0)
;; ⇒ 0
(send errors-counter + 10)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@6a6287b2: 0&gt;
@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 10
</code></pre><p>If you'd prefer an agent to ignore exceptions instead of going into the <em>failure mode</em>, <code>clojure.core/agent</code>
takes an option that controls this behavior: <code>:error-mode</code>. Because completely ignoring errors is rarely a good
idea, when the error mode is set to <code>:continue</code> you must also pass an error handler function:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def errors-counter (agent 0
                           :error-mode    :continue
                           :error-handler (fn [failed-agent ^Exception exception]
                                            (println (.getMessage exception)))))
;; ⇒ #'user/errors-counter
(send errors-counter inc)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@5620e147: 1&gt;
(send errors-counter inc)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@5620e147: 2&gt;
(send errors-counter / 0)
;; output: "Divide by zero"
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@5620e147: 2&gt;
(send errors-counter inc)
;; ⇒ #&lt;Agent@5620e147: 3&gt;
@errors-counter
;; ⇒ 3
</code></pre><p>The handler function takes two arguments: an agent and the exception that occured.</p><h4 id="summary-and-use-cases-1">Summary and Use Cases</h4><p>Agents are asynchronously updated references. They can be used for anything that does
not require strict consistency for reads:</p><ul><li>Counters (e.g. message rates in event processing)</li><li>Collections (e.g. recently processed events)</li></ul><p>Agents can be used for offloading arbitrary computations to a thread pool, however,
only starting with Clojure 1.5 they can provide the same flexiblity as JDK executors
(thread pools).</p><h3 id="refs">Refs</h3><p>Refs are the only <em>coordinated</em> reference type Clojure has. They help ensure that multiple
identities can be modified concurrently within a <em><a href="/articles/language/glossary/#transaction">transaction</a></em>:</p><ul><li>Either all refs are modified or none are</li><li>No race conditions between involved refs</li><li>No possibility of deadlocks between involved refs</li></ul><p>Refs provide ACI of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a>. Refs
are backed by Clojure's implementation of <a href="/articles/language/glossary/#stm"><em>software transactional
memory</em> (STM)</a>.</p><p>To instantiate a ref, use the <code>clojure.core/ref</code> function:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def account-a (ref 0))
;; ⇒ #'user/account-a
(def account-b (ref 0))
;; ⇒ #'user/account-b
</code></pre><p>Like atoms and agents covered earlier, to get the current value of a ref, use <code>clojure.core/deref</code> or the "<code>@</code>"
reader macro:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(deref account-a)
;; ⇒ 0
@account-b
;; ⇒ 0
</code></pre><p>Refs are for coordinated concurrent operations and so it does not make much sense to use a single ref
(in that case, an atom would be sufficient). Refs are modified in a transaction in the <code>clojure.core/dosync</code>
body.</p><p><code>clojure.core/dosync</code> starts a transaction, performs all modifications and commits changes. If a concurrently
running transaction modifies a ref in the current transaction before the current transaction commits,
the current transaction will be <em>retried</em> to make sure that the most recent value of the modified
ref is used.</p><p><em>TBD: a picture that visualizes retries and serializability.</em></p><h4 id="alter">alter</h4><p>Refs are modified using <code>clojure.core/alter</code> which is very similar to
<code>clojure.core/swap!</code> in the arguments it takes: a ref, a function that
takes an old value and returns a new value of the ref, and any number
of optional arguments to pass to the function.</p><p>In the following example, two refs are initialized at 1000,
representing two bank accounts.  Then 100 units are transferred from
one account to the other, atomically:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def account-a (ref 1000))
;; ⇒ #'user/account-a
(def account-b (ref 1000))
;; ⇒ #'user/account-b

(dosync
  ;; will be executed as (+ @account-a 100)
  (alter account-a + 100)
  ;; will be executed as (- @account-b 100)
  (alter account-b - 100))
;; ⇒ 900
@account-a
;; ⇒ 1100
@account-b
;; ⇒ 900
</code></pre><h4 id="conflicts-and-retries">Conflicts and Retries</h4><p><em>TBD: explain transaction conflicts, demonstrate transaction retries</em></p><h4 id="commute">commute</h4><p>With a high number of concurrently running transactions, retries
overhead can become noticeable.  Some modifications, however, can be
applied in any order. Clojure's STM implementation acknowledges this
fact and provides an alternative way to modify refs:
<code>clojure.core/commute</code>. <code>commute</code> must only be used for operations
that <a href="http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.property.glossary.html#commutative">commute in the mathematical
sense</a>:
the order can be changed without affecting the result. For example,
addition is commutative (1 + 10 produces the same result as 10 + 1)
but substraction is not (1 − 10 does not equal 10 − 1).</p><p><code>clojure.core/commute</code> has the same signature as <code>clojure.core/alter</code>:</p><pre><code class="clojure">@account-a
;; ⇒ 1100
@account-b
;; ⇒ 900
(dosync
  (commute account-a + 300)
  (commute account-b + 300))
;; ⇒ 1200
@account-a
;; ⇒ 1400
@account-b
;; ⇒ 1200
</code></pre><p>Note that a change made to a ref by <code>commute</code> will never cause a transaction
to retry. <code>commute</code> does not cause <em>transaction conflicts</em>.</p><h4 id="using-refs-with-clojure-data-structures">Using Refs With Clojure Data Structures</h4><p><em>TBD: demonstrate more complex changes, e.g., to game characters</em></p><h4 id="limitations-of-refs">Limitations of Refs</h4><p>Software transactional memory is a powerful but highly specialized tool. Because transactions can be retried,
you must only use pure functions with STM. I/O operations cannot be undone by the runtime and very often are
not <a href="/articles/language/glossary/#idempotent">idempotent</a>.</p><p>Structuring your application code as <em>pure core</em> and <em>edge code</em> that interacts with the user or other
services (performing I/O operations and other side-effects) helps with this. In that case, the pure core
can use STM without issues.</p><p>For example, in a Web or network server, incoming requests are the edge code: they do I/O. The pure core
is then called to modify server state, do any calculations necessary, return a result that is returned
back to the client by the edge code:</p><p><em>TBD: a picture to demonstrate</em></p><p>Unlike some other languages and runtimes (for example, Haskell), Clojure <em>will not prevent you from
doing I/O in transactions</em>. It is left as a matter of discipline on the programmer's part. It does provide
a helper function, though: <code>clojure.core/io!</code> will raise an exception if there is an STM transaction
running and has no effect otherwise.</p><p>First, an example with pure code:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(io!
  ;; pure code, clojure.core/io! has no effect
  (reduce + (range 0 100)))
;; ⇒ 4950
</code></pre><p>And an example that invokes functions that are guarded with <code>clojure.core/io!</code> in an STM
transaction:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(defn render-results
  "Prints results to the standard output"
  []
  (io!
    (println "Results:")
    (comment ...)))
;; ⇒ #'user/render-results
(dosync
  (alter account-a + 100)
  (alter account-b - 100)

You define them via the <code>def</code> special form:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def url "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita")
</code></pre><p>Functions defined via <code>defn</code> are also stored in vars. Vars can be dynamically scoped. They have
<em>root bindings</em> that are initially visible to all threads. When defining a var
with <code>def</code>, you define a var that only has root binding, so its value will be the same no matter
what thread you use it from:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def url "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita")

and trailing asterisks <code>*</code> (often referred to as "earmuffs").</p><p>In the example above, <code>binding</code> temporarily changed the var's current value to a different URL. But that happened only
in the same thread as the var was originally defined in. What makes vars interesting from the concurrency
point of view is that their bindings can be <em>thread-local</em> (yes, if you are familiar with thread-local variables
in Java or Ruby, it is very similar and serves largely the same purpose). To demonstrate, let's change
the example to spin up 3 threads and alter the var's value from them:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def ^:dynamic *url* "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita")

</code></pre><p>As you can see, var scoping in different threads did not modify the var's value in the thread it was
originally defined in (its <em>root binding</em>). In real-world cases, for example, it means that a multi-threaded
Web crawler can store some crawling state specific to a particular thread in a var and not
modify its initial (global) value.</p><h4 id="how-to-alter-var-root">How to Alter Var Root</h4><p>Sometimes, however, modifying the root binding is necessary. This is done via <code>clojure.core/alter-var-root</code>
which takes a var (not its value) and a function that takes the old var value and returns a new one:</p><pre><code class="clojure">*url*
;; ⇒ "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita"
(.start (Thread. (fn []
                   (alter-var-root (var user/*url*) (fn [_] "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif"))

;; outputs "*url* is now http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif"
;; ⇒ nil
*url*
;; ⇒ "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif"
</code></pre><p><code>clojure.core/var</code> is used to locate the var (<code>user/*url*</code> in our example executed in the REPL). Note that it
finds the var itself (the reference, the "box"), not its value (what the var evalutes to).</p><p>In the example above the function we use to alter var root ignores the current value and simply returns a
predefined string:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(fn [_] "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif")
</code></pre><p>Such functions are common enough for <code>clojure.core</code> to provide a convenience higher-order function called
<code>clojure.core/constantly</code>. It takes a value and returns a function that, when executed, ignores all its parameters
and returns that value. So, the function above would be more idiomatically written as</p><pre><code class="clojure">*url*
;; ⇒ "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita"
(.start (Thread. (fn []
                   (alter-var-root (var user/*url*) (constantly "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif"))

;; outputs "*url* is now http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif"

*url*
;; ⇒ "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif"
</code></pre><p>When is <code>alter-var-root</code> used in real world scenarios? Some Clojure data store and API clients stores active connection
in a var, so initial connection requires root binding modification.</p><h4 id="summary-and-use-cases-3">Summary and Use Cases</h4><p>To summarize: vars can have dynamic scope. They have a root binding and can have thread-local bindings as well.
As such, vars are good for storing pieces of program state that vary between threads but cannot
be stored in a function local. <code>alter-var-root</code> is used to alter root binding of a var. It is done
the functional way: by providing a function that takes the old var value and returns a new one.</p><p>To alter var root to a specific known value, use <code>clojure.core/constantly</code>.</p><h2 id="dereferencing">Dereferencing</h2><p>Earlier sections demonstrated the concept of <em>dereferencing</em>. Dereferencing means retrieving the current
value of a reference (an atom, an agent, a ref, etc). To dereference a Clojure reference, use
<code>clojure.core/deref</code> or the <code>@reference</code> reader macro:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(let [xs (atom [])]
  @xs)
;; ⇒ []
</code></pre><p>Besides atoms, agents, and refs, Clojure has several other concurrency-oriented data structures
that can be dereferenced: delays, futures, and promises. They will be covered later in this
guide.</p><h3 id="dereferencing-support-for-data-types-implemented-in-java">Dereferencing Support For Data Types Implemented In Java</h3><p>It is possible to make custom data types implemented in Java support dereferencing by
making them implement the <code>clojure.lang.</code> interface:</p><pre><code class="java">package clojure.lang;

public interface IDeref{
  Object deref();
}
</code></pre><p>This can be done to make data types implemented in Java look and feel more like built-in
Clojure data types, or make it possible to pass said types to a function that expects
its arguments to be dereferenceable.</p><h2 id="delays">Delays</h2><p>In Clojure, a <em>delay</em> is a data structure that is evaluated the first time it is dereferenced.
Subsequent dereferencing will use the cached value. Delays are instantiated with the <code>clojure.core/delay</code>
function.</p><p>In the following example a delay is used to calculate a timestamp that is later used
as a cached value:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def d (delay (System/currentTimeMillis)))
;; ⇒ #'user/d
d
;; ⇒ #&lt;Delay@21ed22af: :pending&gt;
;; dereferencing causes the value to be realized, it happens only once
@d
;; ⇒ 1350997814621
@d
;; ⇒ 1350997814621
@d
;; ⇒ 1350997814621
</code></pre><p><code>clojure.core/realized?</code> can be used to check whether a delay instance has been realized
or not:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def d (delay (System/currentTimeMillis)))
;; ⇒ #'user/d
(realized? d)
;; ⇒ false
@d
;; ⇒ 1350997967984
(realized? d)
;; ⇒ true
</code></pre><h2 id="futures">Futures</h2><p>A Clojure future evaluates a piece of code in another thread. To instantiate a future,
use <code>clojure.core/future</code>. The <code>future</code> function will return immediately (it never blocks
the current thread). To obtain the result of computation, dereference the future:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def ft (future (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6)))
;; ⇒ #'user/ft
ft
;; ⇒ #&lt;core$future_call$reify__6110@effa25e: 21&gt;
@ft
;; ⇒ 21
</code></pre><p>Dereferencing a future blocks the current thread. Because some operations may take
a very long time or get blocked forever, futures support a timeout specified
when you dereference them:</p><pre><code class="clojure">;; will block the current thread for 10 seconds, returns :completed
(def ft (future (Thread/sleep 10000) :completed))
;; ⇒ #'user/ft
(deref ft 2000 :timed-out)
;; ⇒ :timed-out
</code></pre><p>Subsequent access to futures using <code>deref</code> will use the cached value, just like it
does for delays.</p><p>Just like delays, it is possible to check whether a future is realized or not
with <code>clojure.core/realized?</code>:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(def ft (future (reduce + (range 0 10000))))
;; ⇒ #'user/ft
(realized? ft)
;; ⇒ true
@ft
;; ⇒ 49995000
</code></pre><p>Clojure futures are evaluated in an unbounded, cached thread pool that is also used by agents
(updated via <code>clojure.core/send-off</code>). This works well in many cases but may result in
exhaustion of the heap or thrashing if too many futures are created.</p><p>Finally, Clojure futures implement <code>java.util.concurrent.Future</code> and can be used with Java APIs
that accept them.</p><h2 id="promises">Promises</h2><p>Promises are yet another take on asynchronously realized values. They are similar to futures in
certain ways:</p><ul><li>Can be dereferenced with a timeout</li><li>Caches the realized value</li><li>Supported by <code>clojure.core/realized?</code></li></ul><p>However, promises are realized not by evaluating a piece of code but by calling <code>clojure.core/deliver</code>
on a promise along with a value:</p><pre><code class="clojure">;; promises have no code body (no code to evaluate)
(def p (promise))
;; ⇒ #'user/p
p
;; ⇒ #&lt;core$promise$reify__6153@306a0a21: :pending&gt;
(realized? p)
;; ⇒ false

;; delivering a promise makes it realized
(deliver p {:result 42})
;; ⇒ #&lt;core$promise$reify__6153@306a0a21: {:result 42}&gt;
(realized? p)
;; ⇒ true
@p
;; ⇒ {:result 42}
</code></pre><p>Promises combine many of the benefits of callback-oriented asynchronous programming
and the simpler blocking function calls model provided by dereferencing.</p><h2 id="watches-and-validators">Watches and Validators</h2><p><em>TBD</em></p><h2 id="using-intrinsic-locks-synchronized-in-clojure">Using Intrinsic Locks ("synchronized") in Clojure</h2><h3 id="explicit-locking">Explicit Locking</h3><p>Every object on the JVM has an <em>intrinsic lock</em> (also referred to as <em>monitor lock</em>
or simply <em>monitor</em>). By convention, a thread that needs to modify a field of a
mutable object has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock and then release it.
As long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock, no other thread can acquire the same lock.</p><p>In Clojure, explicit synchronization like this is rarely necessary but may be
needed for interoperability with Java code. When you need to execute a piece
of code while holding an intrinsic lock of a mutable object, use
the <code>clojure.core/locking</code> macro:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(let [l (java.util.ArrayList.)]
  (locking l
    (.add l 10))
  l)

not necessary.</p><h3 id="synchronization-on-clojure-record-fields">Synchronization on Clojure Record Fields</h3><p><em>TBD</em></p><h2 id="reducers-clojure-15">Reducers (Clojure 1.5+)</h2><p><em>TBD</em></p><h2 id="javautilconcurrent">java.util.concurrent</h2><h3 id="overview-2">Overview</h3><p><code>java.util.concurrent</code> (sometimes abbreviated as <code>j.u.c.</code>) is a group of

they are developed and maintained by some of the experts in concurrency.
<code>j.u.c.</code> is a mature library that has been heavily battle tested for
almost a decade.</p><p>While Clojure provides a whole toolbelt of concurrency features of its own,
in certain cases the best solution is to use an existing <code>j.u.c.</code> class
or even build a new abstraction on top of <code>j.u.c.</code> building blocks.</p><p><code>j.u.c.</code> consists of multiple parts that cover common concurrent programming
patterns and use cases: from thread pools (a.k.a. <em>executors</em>) to synchronization
classes, to atomic variables, to concurrent collections, to the Fork/Join
framework.</p><h3 id="executors-thread-pools">Executors (Thread Pools)</h3><h4 id="overview-3">Overview</h4><p>The Executor interface standardizes invocation, scheduling, execution, and control of asynchronous tasks.
Those tasks can be executed in the calling thread, in newly created threads, or (mostly typically)
in a thread pool. Thread pools also can have different implementations: for example,
be fixed size or growing dynamically, using different error handling strategies and so on.</p><p>Executors are most often instantiated using static methods of the <code>java.util.concurrent.Executors</code> class. To submit an operation to the pool, use the <code>ExecutorService#submit</code> method.</p><pre><code class="clojure">(import '[java.util.concurrent Executors ExecutorService Callable])

on group of concurrent workflows: "block the current thread until N other threads are
done with their work". For example, "make a POST request to N URLs and continue when all N operations
succeeded or failed".</p><p>Countdown latches are instances of <code>java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch</code> and instantiated with
a positive integer:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch)

(CountDownLatch. n)
</code></pre><p>When the <code>CountDownLatch#await</code> method is executed, the calling thread blocks until the counter
gets to 0. Invoking the <code>CountDownLatch#countDown</code> method decreases the counter by 1. Count down
operations, of course, are supposed to be performed in other threads.</p><p>An example to demonstrate:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(let [cnt   (atom [])
      n     5
      latch (java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch. n)]
  (doseq [i (range 0 n)]

                       (.countDown latch)))))
  (.await latch)
  @cnt)
;; note the ordering: starting N threads in parallel leads to
;; non-deterministic thread interleaving
;; ⇒ [0 1 2 4 3]
</code></pre><p>In the example above, we start multiple threads and block the current thread until all other
threads are done. In this example, those other threads simply add an integer to a vector
stored in an atom. More realistic scenarios will contact external services, the file system,
perform some computation and so on.</p><p>Because when threads are executed concurrently (or in parallel), the order of their execution is not
guaranteed, we see 4 being added to the vector before 3 in the result.</p><p>Countdown latches are commonly used with initial value of 1 to "block and wait until this operation in
a different thread is done".</p><h3 id="concurrent-collections">Concurrent Collections</h3><p>Most of the Java collections are mutable and were not designed for concurrency. <code>java.util.concurrent</code> includes a number of collections that

conditional atomic update operation (<em>compared-and-swap</em> aka <em>CAS</em>).</p><p>Some of the more popular atomic types in the <code>j.u.c.atomic</code> package are <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicBoolean.html">AtomicBoolean</a>,

other libraries. An example to demonstrate how to use an atomic long for a thread-safe counter:</p><pre><code class="clojure">(let [l (AtomicLong.)]

adoption of <em>message passing</em> concurrency (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor model</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_Sequential_Processes">CSP</a>)
lead to the creation of several JVM-based frameworks for message passing. Some of the most popular ones
include:</p><ul><li><a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a></li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jetlang/">Jetlang</a></li><li><a href="https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/">LMAX Disruptor</a></li></ul><p>Akka's Java API can be used from Clojure either directly or via a library called <a href="https://github.com/gaverhae/okku">Okku</a>.</p><p>In LMAX Disruptor, event instances passed around are assumed to be mutable, so the framework is of limited use with Clojure.</p><h2 id="runtime-parallelism">Runtime Parallelism</h2><p>Clojure was designed to be a hosted language. Its primary target, the
JVM, provides runtime parallelism support.  JVM threads map 1:1 to
kernel threads. Those will be executed in parallel given that enough
cores are available for OS scheduler to use.</p><p>In Clojure, many concurrency features are built on top of JVM threads
and thus benefit from runtime parallelism if the program is running on
a multi-core machine.</p><h2 id="books">Books</h2><p>Concurrency is a broad topic and it would be silly to think that we
can cover it well in just one guide.  To get a better understanding of
the subject, one can refer to a few excellent books:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601">Java Concurrency in Practice</a> by Brian Goetz et al. is a true classic.</li><li><a href="http://pragprog.com/book/vspcon/programming-concurrency-on-the-jvm">Programming Concurrency on the JVM</a> demonstrates a range of concurrency features in several JVM languages.</li></ul><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2><p>One of Clojure design goals was to make concurrent programming easier.</p><p>The key design decision was making Clojure data structures immutable
(persistent) and separating the concepts of <em>identity</em> (references)
and <em>value</em>. Immutable values eliminate many concurrency hazards, and
ultimately make it easier for developers to reason about their
programs.</p><p>Atoms are arguably the most commonly used reference type when working
with concurrency (vars are used much more often but not for their
concurrency semantics). Software Transactional Memory is a more
specialized feature and has certain limitations (e.g., I/O operations
must not be performed inside transactions). Finally, agents, futures,
and promises provide an array of tools for working with asynchronous
operations.</p><p>Concurrency is a hard fundamental problem. There is no single "best"
solution or approach to it. On the JVM, Clojure offers several
concurrency-related features of its own but also provides easy access
to the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> primitives and libraries such as
<a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> or
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jetlang/">Jetlang</a>.</p><h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2><p>Michael Klishin <a href="mailto:michael@defprotocol.org">michael@defprotocol.org</a>, 2012 (original author)</p>
